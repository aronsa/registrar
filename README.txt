Notes: 
Our paper is in the main directory (with this file)

To run our code, make sure you have python3 installed. You can run the code by running sh run.sh constraints.txt studentprefs.txt schedule.txt

notice that the files demo_studentprefs.txt demo_constraints.txt and schedule.txt will also be present. Pay no mind to them if they are not the names of the files you are running (the script is a little janky, we apologize)

To view the data from our expiriments, go to haverford/expN, where N in {1,2,3}
Notice that main.py for haverford data is slightly different

If you want to run a test on a randomly generated set of data, you are welcome to use ./generateInput.sh
